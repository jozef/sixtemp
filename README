NAME

    sixtemp_sensor.ino - read up to six 1-wire temperature sensors using
    Arduino and show their status using R(G)B led

SYNOPSIS

    See https://github.com/jozef/sixtemp_i2c for example and usage.

DESCRIPTION

    Arduino based sensor that can read up to six 1-wire DS18B20
    temperatures. Temperature sensors addresses are permanently stored in
    eeprom so that same positions are assigned between power-cycles. It
    provides the temperature readings via I2C interface and it also shows
    the temperature using 6xred-blue leds.

I2C CLIENT

    Connected to I2C, by default, responds on 0x18 address.

    First I2C master has to send one byte which is the read/write address.
    Addresses are:

        0x01        led on/off bool flag
        0x21        set led on/off flag. second byte is flag value
        0x60        read 1 byte with number of sensors
        0x61..0x66  read 14 bytes of sensor 1..6 data:
                        struct sixtemp_sensor {
                            bool has_error;
                            bool has_address;
                            int16_t tdeg;
                            char address[8];
                        };

SERIAL INTERFACE

    Using Arduino serial port:

        $ minicom --device /dev/ttyUSB1
        eeprom magic found: 6temp 0.02

    ^^^ start-up message in case if sensors and configuration was read
    successfully from eeprom.

 help/?

    Prints version and available commands:

        > ?
        6temp 0.02
        supported commands:
          temp            - show temperatures from all sensors
          forget idx      - forget sensor on position idx
          info            - show sram usage and configuration
          set i2c [num]   - set i2c address (0x18 is default)
          tled [num]      - do led blink test num times (1 is default)
          help/?          - print this help

 info

    Prints version and debug/info:

        > info
        6temp 0.02
        sram free: 1158
        current configuration:
            i2c_addr: 0x18
            i2c_register: 0x0

 temp

    Prints all available temparature sensor readings:

        > temp
        sensor 1/6 [286164122f910528]: ERROR
        sensor 2/6 [28ff3ff6a1160322]: 22.0 C
        sensor 3/6 [286164122e7c499a]: 24.0 C
        sensor 4/6 [286164122f88f163]: 24.0 C

        sensor 6/6 [286164122f89682a]: 24.0 C

 forget

    Forget one temperature sensor:

        > forget 1
        temp address 1 forgotten
    
        > temp
        sensor 1/6: n/a
        sensor 2/6 [28ff3ff6a1160322]: 22.0 C
        sensor 3/6 [286164122e7c499a]: 24.0 C
        sensor 4/6 [286164122f88f163]: 24.0 C
        sensor 5/6 [28ffa59492160558]: ERROR
        sensor 6/6 [286164122f89682a]: 24.0 C

    head2 set i2c

    Change I2C client address:

        > set i2c 0x20
        setting i2c address to: 0x20
    
        > info
        6temp 0.02
        sram free: 1158
        current configuration:
            i2c_addr: 0x20
            i2c_register: 0x0
    
        > set i2c
        setting i2c address to: 0x18

 tled

    Will fade-in/out red leds and sequentially (1 to 6) blink with both
    red/blue leds to test if all are wired correctly:

        > tled 2
        testing 1/2
        fade all in/out red
        blink red
         red 1
         red 2
         red 3
         red 4
         red 5
         red 6
        LED test.
        blink blue
         blue 1
         blue 2
         blue 3
         blue 4
         blue 5
         blue 6
        testing 2/2
        ...
